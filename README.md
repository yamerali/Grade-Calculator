# Grade-Calculator

My university's program planning tools often miscalculated a students GPA, so I developed a tool to make it easier for me to calculate my grades while in university. Instead of having to manually punch in over 20 numbers to calculate my GPA every time I wanted to check my progress, I could create a single text file to store my grades and have a program quickly compute my GPA. The program works by prompting the user for the name of a text file containing grade information and reading in the values from the file. 

The calculator accounts for different course credits (full or half) and assignment weights.

Example input files are included in /textfiles.
